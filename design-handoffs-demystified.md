# Design Handoffs Demystified: Strategies for Improving Collaboration Between Frontend Developers and Designers

## Abstract

When was the last time you and your UX designer have talked past each other?
You may have observed that even though you share common goals, the perspective of your designer on both the bigger picture and the smallest details sometimes differ greatly from yours.
Let's try to close these gaps!
This talk illustrates common patterns of miscommunication between designers and developers and how to spot or, even better, prevent them.
Learn how you and your designer can cover each others blind spots to get the most out of your collaboration.
We'll dissect the classical design handoff, where the designer hands a fully defined specification to the developer, and which is mostly addressed in design blogs:
why is it destined to fail us and how can we re-imagine the process to our benefit?

## Details

Designers and developers bring different backgrounds and knowledge to the table.
Naturally, we sometimes use terms the other doesn't understand, or mean different things by them, which can be frustrating.
I will share some tales of misunderstandings I've had with designers in the past, and what they taught me.

The centerpiece of designer-developer-interaction is the design handoff.
It is easy to fall into the trot of "classical handoffs", a persistent relic of Waterfall methodology.
It's outdated and doesn't serve us well, still it is practiced a lot.
Because what could a developer contribute to design and vice versa?

We should not shy away from trying to understand each others' viewpoint and get more involved in the design process from an early stage,
as well as keeping our designer nearby during implementation.
Close collaboration between designers and developers comes with lots of benefits:

- pointing out technical constraints during the ideation phase leads to easier-to-implement designs
- our professional pessimism helps detect missing unhappy paths in the design
- understanding and incorporating the designer's mental model improves maintainability of our implementation
- interacting with the (half-)implemented result already provides valuable feedback to the designer

## Pitch

Through four years of work on design systems at two companies and as a technical lead,
I experienced firsthand how easy and how hard it can be to find common ground and a good working mode with UX designers.
I would like to share my learnings and challenge developers to think about how to improve collaboration with their designer counterparts.
Currently, the discussion of what makes a good design handover is mostly taking place between designers, while developers on the receiving end can contribute valuable insights.
